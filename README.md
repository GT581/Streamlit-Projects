# Streamlit Projects
 Github repo for all projects in my streamlit app: https://gt581dev.streamlit.app/

 The Home page on Streamlit describes each project in more detail, but at a high level here is what the code in each folder in this repo contains:

 App:  
 Contains all Streamlit and execution logic code

 Pipelines:  
 Contains all ETL code that pulls data from external sources (APIs, Web Scraping, etc.) used in the apps

 Pages:  
 Executes each project within the app in a separate page

 Reference:  
 Contains static examples of data used during the development of some of the projects.  
 For example, JSON files from API requests and DDL / CDC SQL files used in a database for local web app versions.
